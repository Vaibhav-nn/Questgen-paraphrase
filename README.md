# Questgen AI
Questgen AI is focused on developing Question generation algorithms using state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing models. It provides easy to use classes and enables you to be one call away from generating questions out of any given parapgraph in your required format, be it MCQ, Single word, Boolean type or Paraphrasing.

*Currently we are focused on generating questions that are gramatically correct and semantically meaningful in nature using Text-to-Text Transfer Transformers (T5).*

### Various formats of Questions generated by the library are:- 
<pre>
  -- Normal Questions :     (What,Where,Who,how,When etc) <br>
  -- MCQ Questions :        Generate Questions with answers and similar options <br>
  -- Boolean Questions :    (Is,Did,Does etc) Output is expected either True/False <br>
  -- Paraphrase Questions : Generate similar but different questions from a given question 
</pre>
